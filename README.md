# Module_1_Lesson_2_hw_3_TextView_EditText_Button
Lesson's topic:

Operators: arithmetic, logical, comparisons.

Technical task:

Write a program for an automatic bus fare collection system.
Task:
1) At the input, you set the variables that characterize the passenger (think about which ones).
2) If there is a child in front of you, then allow free passage.
2) If an adult, then demand a fare. If payment has been made - allow passage, if there is no payment - do not allow.
3) If a pensioner, then require a pension certificate. If there is a pension certificate - allow passage, otherwise - don't allow.
Make it using the TextView on the screen.

Screen recoding (please, note that it was converted to GIF, so it's not smooth as it was):
